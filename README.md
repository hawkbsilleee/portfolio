# 👋 Hi, I'm Ethan Seiz

I'm a student at Brown University interested in building tools that help people and improve their daily lives. Before transferring to Brown this year, I was a Freshman at Cornell University, and before that, I grew up in New York City. My research interests lie in computational fabrication, computer vision, deep learning, and application-specific integrated circuits. Outside of research, I also work on Project Teams and indiviudal projects, where I've developed full-stack websites and iOS apps, and design and build robots and assistive technology.

Welcome to my engineering portfolio, where I highlight some of the projects I’ve had the privilege to work on.
